# Exercise 1: Create a Template

The purpose of this exercise to create the template that your web component will copy.

It needs to retain the same DOM structure as each individual album cover

The markup within the template should have no content. So you can remove the text content of the `h3` and `p` tags, as well as the values of the `src` and `alt` attributes. You can leave these as empty strings for now.

Once this has been completed, the tests at the top of the page will pass and you can move on to exercise two.
