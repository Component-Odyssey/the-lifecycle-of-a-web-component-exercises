# Exercise 1: Add lifecycle methods to the carousel web component

The purpose of this exercise is to become more familiar with the most common web component lifecycle methods.

You'll need to implement functionality into the following functions:

- `contructor()`
- `connectedCallback()`
- `static get observedAttributes()`
- `attributeChangedCallback()`
- `disconnectedCallback`

The code is annotated to give some basic instructions about what you need to implement.

## Note

All of the behaviour outside of the lifecycle methods has already been implemented. So you don't need to worry about:
- styling
- DOM structure
- wiring up the image scroll

I've added a few unrealistic restrictions on the component for the sake of the exercise, so please don't use this component in your own libraries.

Once you've implemented everything correctly, all the tests should pass.
